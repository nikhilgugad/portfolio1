                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="about-text">
                    I am a front-end developer and graphic designer with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as
                    well as front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js. I specialize in logo and icon design using Adobe
                    Photoshop and Illustrator, and I have strong skills in video editing and motion graphics with
                    Premiere Pro and After Effects. I am also proficient in MS Office and can type at 70 words per
                    minute. I am passionate about creating visually appealing and functional digital experiences. Based
                    in Kuchaman City, Rajasthan, India, I’m always eager to learn and grow in both design and
                    development.

                <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
                <p class="about-text">
                    When I'm not coding, you can often find me on the cricket field, engaging in fast bowling or
                    strategizing my next move in a game of chess. These activities bring balance, excitement, and a
                    sense of discipline to my life. Cricket not only keeps me physically active but also sharpens my
                    reflexes, endurance, and teamwork skills, as it’s a sport that demands quick decision-making and
                    coordination with teammates. It’s a great way to stay fit and relieve stress after long hours of
                    coding. On the other hand, chess is a game that stimulates my mind and hones my problem-solving
                    abilities. The strategic thinking involved in chess helps me approach challenges with a more
                    analytical mindset, which translates well into my work as a developer and designer. Both of these
                    hobbies complement each other, as cricket keeps me agile and focused, while chess strengthens my
                    ability to think several steps ahead. Together, they help me maintain a well-rounded and balanced
                    lifestyle.

                <h1>Future Goals</h1>
                <p class="about-text">
                    Looking ahead, my primary goal is to become a proficient software engineer and a master web
                    developer. I am deeply committed to continuously honing my technical skills and staying updated with
                    the latest trends and advancements in technology. With a passion for both problem-solving and
                    creative design, I aim to develop solutions that not only meet the needs of users but also push the
                    boundaries of what’s possible in the digital world. By contributing to innovative projects, I hope
                    to create products that have a meaningful impact—whether it’s improving user experiences, enhancing
                    functionality, or shaping the way people interact with technology. My journey is driven by a passion
                    for continuous learning, and I strive to remain adaptable and open-minded to new tools, frameworks,
                    and methodologies. Ultimately, I aim to build exceptional digital experiences that inspire, engage,
                    and provide value, all while advancing my expertise and contributing to the ever-evolving tech
                    landscape.
